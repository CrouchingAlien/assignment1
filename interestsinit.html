<h3> Interests in Information Technology </h3>


   <p> My interests in Information technology began when I was first playing Runescape with my sister and started sending message to other computer using cmd at school. I enjoyed playing with auto clickers, and fiddling around with tracking applications to what would ultimately result in perma bans, but not before id had my fun. I am currently I am interested in block chain and cyber security because I believe knowledge and education on these will become invaluable in the future, to prospective employers and myself. </p>
<p>Following blockchain development over the passed few years is what has mostly peaked my interest in the IT world, its upward scalability is seems to have no limit. With little knowledge about the workings in the Information Technology space I’m excited to grow and learn, as I get further through this course.

</p>
<p>I chose RMIT as opposed to other potential study options because of the flexibility it provides the students with a fully online degree. The access to tutors and recording of webinars if they are missed or if I need to I can always view them again. The course I’m undertaking is fully online which fits into my lifestyle and made it an easier choice to return to study from the workforce. RMIT was an easy choice because of how fluid it was to apply and understand what I am looking at. Other universities I came across were quite vague about how to apply, the requirements and even the courses themselves weren’t explained properly
</p>
<p>Throughout the course the degree I’m hoping I learn how to apply the knowledge I will gain about Information Technology to create or help build new, exciting and innovative software. Getting the know how to build my own ideas and share them with the world is the end state I’m expecting.
