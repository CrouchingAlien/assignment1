<p>Some information on me, I have recently changed careers. My last job was as an Airfield Defence Guard (ADG) and after a fruitful military career, 2 deployments and some all but enjoyable injuries I have decided to focus on studying Information Technology.
I’ve always been somewhat interested in IT and am at a point in my life where I can focus on study and improving myself instead of working for somebody else.
</p>

<p>I was born in Windsor Australia and grew up in Katherine NT, culturally speaking; I’m basic as hell, European heritage with that being all the information I have.
Even though I didn’t complete high school, I have previously completed other tertiary qualifications including; Cert IV Fitness, Cert III in Government and Cert III in Business.
Recently I’ve been learning Russian and I can confidently read and speak at a toddlers level, I think.</p>

<p>I enjoy fitness and challenging myself to try new things.
In my spare time I watch anime, play golf, play online games, if I’m not doing either of those id likely be with friends or taking a mean nap.
