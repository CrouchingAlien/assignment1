<h2>My project idea</h2>

<h1>The Swapper</h1>

<p>The swapper will be a standalone webpage that provides a stable, secure, anonymous and cheap way to trade your crypto currencies.
Users will be able trade crypto quickly and cheaply. This project may sound like many others that are out there, but the major differences that will make it stand out from the others are the ability to trade crypto currencies without connecting your wallet and even without identity verification, because of this, it wont be possible to use fiat to make trades.
Simply, a token or coin swap with a small fee applied in order to facilitate the exchanges.
</p>
<p>Another project is already out there like this and it can reach up to 200,000 monthly users with revenues averaging around $50,000 per month. I believe creating a simpler, friendlier option would entice users that aren’t currently happy with the services provided by these other websites to use this platform.  Having fewer functions than other websites, it would have to cater to a very niche corner of that market. Just Bitcoin transactions alone across the dark net had totaled almost $400 million in the first quarter of 2020, and I’d guarantee those people would probably like to diversify their portfolio.
</p>
<p>The swapper will service as an intermediary for people who want to trade their currencies without the need to connect their wallet to anything and without the need to send it to an exchange in order to make the swap. It will support the main crypto currencies and will switch between each of them. The user will select their currency they wish to trade from and select with one they want. After choosing the user will provide their receiving wallet address. After an appropriate number of confirmations have been reached the user will receive a confirmation that their coins are on the way.</p>
<p>The exchange of each token will have a small fee added so that the swap can be facilitated. This way of trading currencies increases wallet security by providing a fully separated exchange with no need to directly connect a wallet or have the users currencies held in an online wallet. Users will only need to sign up and provide basic information with no requirement for KYC verification as there will be no way to facilitate a fiat exchange.  Each user will have the ability to register an account and earn rewards for continued use. This will help create a friendly environment for continued users to place their own pools onto the site and have people trade portions, or even the full amount from their offers.
</p>
<p>Having users create their own pools will increase the trust for others by enabling a P2P experience with The Swapper acting as essentially an escrow service. They will be able to select which users are able to access their offers by pre-designating minimum amounts, maximum amounts, which types of crypto they are willing to accept for the trade and whether an account is required to register before accessing their pool. This system will give the option to all users to trade with the website or by accepting offers/creating offers and trading with other users. This P2P feature will enable people the ability to select a price they wish to trade their crypto for, or a % above or below current market price that can fluctuate with the ever-changing crypto market.
</p>
<p>The swapper will be fully transparent with no hidden fees, terms and conditions or data collection. The only input data that is required will be wallets used to receive the crypto after the exchange has been made, unless the user wishes to create an account and take advantage of the rewards that would be available for long term users. The data that is given by the user when registering will only be used to confirm their account when performing transactions, contacting support and being notified of their pools when they have been used or if a user will request to use their pool without meeting the initially set requirements of that pool. All of these functions will work together to provide a more user friendly and efficient experience for individuals when wanting to make exchanges while remaining completely decentralized unlike other applications.
</p>
<p>Some of the main tools required for this application to work are as follows; Deposit and withdrawal functions, the ability to check on transaction confirmations in order to complete each exchange, an API that connects users to the exchange script and assists in facilitating trades, an automatic refund for failed or cancelled transactions or anything else required from the users input.
Another important required is an Admin panel for maintenance, support or any other actions that need to be managed.
A signup and login function for users that want to take full advantage of the rewards that will be available.
</p>
<p>The skills required for this include; the ability to design the website or application, client-side logics of the entire website, an API, security and potentially a native blockchain.
This can cost 10s of thousands of dollars to set up by hiring the appropriate specialists, or one can cut costs on such an application by learning some of the necessary core skills for it’s development. It is unlikely to be feasible for me to learn the skills required for something like this during this course or throughout my studies, with no monetary set backs it would be a significantly easier process.
</p>

<p>If The Swapper were to become successful now it would potentially help provide a safe and efficient way to trade crypto currencies whilst collecting a fee on each transaction made. The original problem of not being able to exchange crypto currencies fluidly without the need for extensive and invasive signup procedures put forward by legal requirements surrounding the crypto world will no longer be a concern to users of The Swapper. It will help avoid the need for sending currencies onto a centralized market or connecting a wallet to a decentralized market, which can lead to loss of crypto currencies.
