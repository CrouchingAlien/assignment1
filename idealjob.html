<h1> My ideal job </h1>

<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/55173330?type=standard#searchRequestToken=c042c2e7-b430-4a33-a8bb-835a3373fdd0">Click here to view job advertisement<a/></p>


   <p> A junior software developer is someone who writes basic code, maintains applications, fix bugs, and deploy app enhancements.
This is a crucial step in gaining more knowledge and experience to pursue a more successful and challenging career in information technology. This is would be the ideal job to begin working towards developing my own applications in the future and would help me grow as an IT professional.
 </p>
<p>The ideal person for this job would have a solid understanding of most things IT. Including front end and back end development experience, a solid understand of databasing systems, knowledge of coding tools and specific web service infrastructure, knowledge of python java C programming languages and the list continues on.
Overall having a strong history in information technology as a whole and an extensive background with quality experience within the IT sector is the main take away that any applicant will need in order to be successful in applying for this job. ( I haven’t included the behavioural requirements such as ‘A love of problem-solving, investigating problems and determining the appropriate fix’ because they kind of just come with the territory)

</p>
<p>As of current I have little experience and no qualifications that align with this job other than what we have learned on this course to date. Which include a very basic level of html, css stylesheets and some python that I have been learning in introduction to programming.
To begin with, to gain the necessary qualifications I am undertaking a Bachelor in IT. Following the degree I will hope to find a workplace that facilitates the growth of my skills and learning in a way that will assist me in reaching my goal. After I believe I understand and meet the requirements of that job or a position that is similar I will apply.
If I still lack the qualifications for that or a similar position I will continue learning more and furthering my own capabilities in order to reach the required competencies.
